    The chart represents the 2011 Federal Budget proposal of $3.69 trillion. This tree map, published by New York Times during Obama's presidency, 
    visually depicts the United State's 2011 budget break down sized according to the amount of spending for that category, where as the colors 
    show the percentage change in the spending from 2010. <br>
    Treemap not only works well for hierarchical data, it is also good to visualize a large number of categories with part-to-whole relationship.
    But this chart looks very clumsy and make audience put more effort than necessary to understand the budget.

    The chart represents the State of Washington 2003-2013 Washington budget. This chart explains us the difference between the real vs the Nominal 
    Budgets where we can observe the adjustment of inflation. This explains how much more amount is needed to match the inflation of that year.<br>
    Area charts works very well with measuring data with one or more rows to compare. Its very easy to read and self explanatory. The only downside of this 
    is, it would become hard to understand if we have many rows.
